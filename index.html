            Scriabin is considered to be one of the greatest composers of all time. Missing out on Scriabin because of his style is like not reading classic novels written in other languages because the translations don’t perfectly match modern English. Try and listen to his Etude Op. 8 No. 12 in D-sharp minor. It is filled with emotion and is easier to listen to than his more intense pieces. From there, I would move to his 24 Preludes Op. 11, as they start off sublime and turn more and more into the Scriabin that musicians fear. Finally, to get the true Scriabin experience, I would listen to his Le Poème de l'Extase, Op. 54 as this is the epitome of Scriabin’s influential and experimental music. To classical music enthusiasts, he is beloved and treasured; to most, he is unknown. For all music-lovers, Scriabin is worth a listen.
